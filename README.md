****Dynamic Cricket Performance Analytics Dashboard****

***Overview***

Welcome to the Dynamic Cricket Performance Analytics Dashboard project, built using Power BI. This dashboard analyzes cricket players' performance across five key roles and provides actionable insights to aid team selection, optimize player roles, and track performance trends in a tournament setting.

***Objective***

The main goal of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard that:

Analyzes player performance across various roles (Openers, Middle Order Specialists, All-Rounders, Finishers, and Fast Bowlers).

Provides advanced metrics like strike rate, batting average, boundary percentage, and position-specific efficiency.

Tracks performance consistency and offers insights for strategic decision-making in team selection.

***Key Features***

**Player Analysis Across Key Roles:**

In-depth analysis of players in five crucial roles:

Openers
Middle Order Specialists
All-Rounders
Finishers
Fast Bowlers

**Advanced Metrics & Visuals:**

Performance trends per match.
Correlation between strike rate and batting average.
Boundary percentage tracking.
Batting efficiency based on position.

**Interactive Player Comparison Matrix:**

Comparative study of top performers like Jos Buttler and Alex Hales.
Performance consistency analysis.
Impact scoring metrics for players based on their role.

**Tournament-Specific Insights:**

Filters to view data for different tournament stages (e.g., Qualifiers/Super 12).

**Tools & Technologies**

*Microsoft Power BI:*
